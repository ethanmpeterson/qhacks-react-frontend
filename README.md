# CircuitSafe ReactJS Frontend
## QHacks 2019
CircuitSafe is my QHacks which takes a binary PCB gerber file and some numerical values as input to give users insights about how their circuit will behave before they get it fabricated and test it.

#### Installation & Demo

- First head to https://github.com/rsgc-peterson-e/qhacks-2019-backend and follow the installation instructions for the backend
- Run the following:
- `git clone https://github.com/rsgc-peterson-e/qhacks-react-frontend/`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- This will open a development copy of our website in your browser

### What's Next for CircuitSafe

I will continue the development of this as a side project and collect more data from the gerber files themselves using less user input.
